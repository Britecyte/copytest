Current treatment options primarily focus on managing symptoms, while many patients ultimately progress to joint replacement surgery. There remains a significant need for therapies that address the underlying disease process.",

It is an engineered adipose therapy comprised of an adipose-derived stem cells and tissue. By leveraging Britecyte's adipose platform technology, BRC-Liver is designed to address adipose dysfunction, a root cause of the complex inflammatory and fibrotic processes that drive disease progression while supporting the liver's natural ability to repair. BRC-Liver has demonstrated reductions in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in preclinical models of MASLD/MASH.",
      "To advance the BRC-Liver therapy from preclinical into the clinical development phase our current research is focused on understanding BRC-Liver mechanisms of action in MASLD/MASH treatment, optimization of BRC-Liver therapeutic doses and treatment regimen, and optimization of the manufacturing process and testing.",

It is an engineered adipose therapy comprised of an adipose-derived stem cells and tissue. By leveraging Britecyte's adipose platform technology, BRC-Wound is designed to restore the microvasculature and create the biological environment needed to support tissue repair and healing. In preclinical studies, BRC-Wound demonstrated rapid vascularization and accelerated wound closure in a challenging ischemic wound model.",
